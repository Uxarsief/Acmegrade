## Problem Statement 
### Create a CNN model on MNIST dataset for written digit classification
The goal is to create a model capable of accurately classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9). Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit it represents.

#### Steps we will follow
1)Data Processing
2)CNN Model Architecture
3)Model Compilation
4)Model Training
5)Evaluation
6)Prediction and Visualization
